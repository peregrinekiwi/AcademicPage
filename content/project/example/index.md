A workshop at Reception Studies -- State of the Discipline and New Directions (Hosted online by Massey University, July 2021.)

"If you’ve ever thought about designing a tabletop game about your research area to play in the classroom but don’t know where to start, then this is the workshop for you! Classicist and game designer Hamish Cameron will give a brief introduction to some general design concepts and considerations, then you’ll split into groups to brainstorm how you might start turning your idea into a game. The session will be a combination of Game Design for Academics and social hour. You probably won’t design a complete game, but you might get some cool ideas that lead to a complete game later. You’ll also get to chat with other folk interested in designing games for the classroom."
