Hamish Cameron is a Lecturer in Classics at Victoria University of Wellington where he works on the history and geography of the Roman Near East, representations of imperialism in classical literature, and reception in modern analog and digital games. He is also a tabletop game designer, with two published roleplaying games, The Sprawl (2016) and Dinosaur Princesses (2019). He is currently working on several other games including a board game on Romano-Parthian Mesopotamia that he created for a class on historical board game design and a roleplaying game of occult horror set in Imperial Rome.

 sed dux atque imperator vitae mortalium animus est. qui ubi ad gloriam virtutis via grassatur, abunde pollens potensque et clarus est neque fortuna eget, quippe quae probitatem, industriam aliasque artis bonas neque dare neque eripere quoiquam potest. sin captus pravis cupidinibus ad inertiam et voluptates corporis pessum datus est, perniciosa lubidine paulisper usus, ubi per socordiam vires tempus ingenium diffluxere, naturae infirmitas accusatur: suam quisque culpam auctores ad negotia transferunt.
 Sallust, *BJ* 1.3-4
