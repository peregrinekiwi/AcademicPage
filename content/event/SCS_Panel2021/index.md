location: Online (ASU)
address:
  city: Phoenix
  region: AZ
  country: United States

summary: A panel discussion organised by Dr Britta Ager (ASU), Sponsored by the Society for Classical Studies
abstract: "Video games frequently draw inspiration from the ancient world: classics like *Kid Icarus*, recent hits like *Hades*, and lesser known gems like *Heavenâ€™s Vault* and *Apotheon*. Why do so many games use ancient culture, what makes a great game, and what games do we wish existed? Join us for a roundtable on the joys of playing with the past.
